Random Generator as a Service (RGaaS)
The goal is to implement a service 	that generates random numbers (random bytes). 	
A server and an example client should be provided.
The length of the random byte sequence should be specified by the client,
the server should handle multiple random number requests per connection.
The quality of the random generator is not essential,
you can use a standard C pseudorandom function or any cryptographically secure generator.

<command><arg> (can	be lower or upper mixed)
	command	R	as Request
			arg	P as ping			
Example: "rp" == server reply = "Ping OK!"

      arg	two digit	for lenght				
Example: "r18" == 18 char long number sent by the server				
Example: "R65" == 65 char long number sent by the server
